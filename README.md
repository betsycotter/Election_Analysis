# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview

Our clients, Tom and Seth, work for the Colorado Board of Elections. They have asked us to review some results for a U.S. congressional precinct in Colorado. They would like to know the total number of votes, details about the votes for each candidate, and the winner of the election based on the popular vote. They have requested help in automating this process using Python, so that they can use the code for other elections. 

They have requested the following data: 
1. The total number of votes cast
2. A complete list of candidates who received votes
3. The percentage of votes each candidate won
4. The total number of votes each candidate won
5. The winner of the election based on popular vote. 


## Resources

- Software: Python 3.9.12, Visual Studio Code 1.73.0
